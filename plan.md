we are making "high c's cinema" or "hicc"

hicc's long term goal is to be a react native android tv rewrite/remake of another project called watchy.

the source code for watchy lives in reference/watchy and is to be used for reference ONLY

for now i would like to get an MVP app together that will run on android tv. it should support the following features from watchy:


1. search apibay for magnet links
2. unlock magnet links on alldebrid
3. view the video files of an unlocked magnet
4. play the video files of an unlocked 

this is the minimum acceptable mvp. it is critical this project should only target to run on android tv.
